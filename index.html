          “<b>Brownie</b> is the name of my pet dog. He has long, <i>drooping </i>ears with a mix of white, black and brown fur on his body. He is of Beagle breed. We adopted him from a dog care centre in our neighbourhood when he was just a month old. He has a cute face with little paws and eyes and has a tiny tail. He is a healthy dog with a shiny coat.

        Brownie runs very fast with his four tiny legs. He watches our house at night. In case of any noise, he barks out loudly. Although he barks at strangers, he never bites them. He loves eating vegetables and I sometimes offer him meat and fish to eat. I bathe him once every few days and play with him in the garden to ensure he is exposed to sunlight and fresh air every day.
        
        My pet, Brownie is close to me and I love him very much. He cheers me up whenever I’m upset and we go for a walk every morning. He wags his tail with joy when I return from school. I take him to the veterinary doctor occasionally for vaccination. He is not just my pet dog, but my best friend too. He is indeed a blessing in my life.”
        <ul>
            <li>He likes to use my ankle as a chin rest.
                <ol>
                  <li>He is fond of nectarines.</li>
                  <li>He smiles. He really does.</li>
                  <li>An empty yogurt container can entertain him for the better part of an afternoon.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>He has no problem with sleeping in.
                <ul>
                 <li>He responds to several nicknames including Carlie, Noodle, Noosie, Noo-del, Rosemarino, Carleen, Carlata, Shamu and, occasionally, Le Pamplemouse.</li>
                 <li>Before I met him, his personality was described to me as ambitious, and this truly fits him.</li>
                 <li>He is very busy.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>He is the most curious dog I have ever met.
                <ol>
                 <li>If I am at my desk for more than three hours in a row, He will go to the bathroom door (the farthest he can get from my desk and still be in my apartment), take a running start and hurl himself into my chair legs, repeatedly, until I leave my desk.</li>
                 <li>He snorts.</li>        
                 <li>When he wants attention, he does what I call the chomp-chomp. He bites at the air, twice, with an additional burst of growl.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>He loves my dad.</li>
            <li>When He is pleased he will slide one side of her face across the floor, tail in the air, while grunting.</li>
            <li>Did I mention he likes to use my ankle as a chin rest?</li>
            <li>He taught me squirrel is a verb.</li>
            <li>Brownie's coat is supposed to be straight, but hers has a curl to it.</li>
            <li>With new people, he keeps it close to the vest.</li>
            <li>He is not wild about little children, but he is kind to them.</li>
            <li>About two weeks after I brought him home, Brownie and I were walking on Lexington Avenue. A woman, who was by my estimate well into her eighties, stopped me and said, “I had a Beagle.”  I smiled. Her eyes filled up with tears and she told me, “She was the love of my life!” Now that I know Brownie, I can understand how that would be true.</li>
        </ol>

        Dogs are indeed very <u>intelligent</u> and <em>responsive</em> pets who <strong>protect</strong> us from external dangers. We hope the above sample essay of my pet dog helps young ones to understand the importance of having a dog as a pet and how to draft an essay on this particular topic.
