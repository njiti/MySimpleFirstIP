          “<b>Francis</b> is my name. I am a, <i>whooping</i>six feet tall, dark skined and very enthusiastic when it comes to changing the world. I am a highschool graduate of Mang'u Highschool ,and also a student at Moringa school. 
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>I graduated with my highschool diploma from The Mang'u Highschool.I currently have no work experience and is looking for a paid internship. I have a clean condact and have never been involved in any major chaos both in school or outside</p>
        <br>
        <p>The reason why i  pursue programming is because we are living in the era of technology, and technological growth is nowhere near stopping. As the use of technological devices is growing every year, there will always be a high demand for programmers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that within this decade, computer programming jobs would mostly be available to those outside the United States. This due to the fact that companies are considering employing people all around the world since they would pay them lower wages.

            However, jobs such as software developing, web developing, computer system analysts, and others show a good career outlook for the next 10 years. Their estimated growth is from 9% and up to 21% for software development jobs.
